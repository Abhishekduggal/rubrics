This will get you to 26/28 points. You will need to add just a little more to make it a full project.

Maybe instead of simple todos they have more information that shows in a pop up modal when you click on them.  

Maybe you can mark them complete instead of just deleting them, which will add to a points total.  Turning it into a gamification platform.


Maybe you hit a 3rd party api to populate your initial list.

Maybe you have two lists you can move the tasks between.

Maybe they are cards instead of tasks and you make a recipe viewer.
